# React-Portfolio-20

This project is a single-page portfolio application built using React and Vite. 

It is designed to showcase my work, including project samples, a bio, and contact information, with a modern and responsive design. 

The portfolio features sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with smooth navigation and interactive elements. 

Deployed on Netlify, this portfolio aims to provide potential employers and collaborators with a comprehensive view of my skills and experience. 

Future enhancements will include backend integration for the contact form.
